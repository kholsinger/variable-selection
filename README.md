## An overview of variable selection in multiple regression

This repository contains a series of [R
notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) I
developed to illustrate some basic principles of variable selection in
multiple regression. I make no claim to be an expert. I am simply
sharing what I understand about the principles. You'll need to have
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed to take
full advantage of the R notebook features, but the open source version
of RStudio has served my needs well,<a href="#fn1"

space.

<li id="fn1">I've been using editors long enough, though, that I only use the
    editor in RStudio when I'm editing an R notebook. Otherwise,
    [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is my
    editor of choice.

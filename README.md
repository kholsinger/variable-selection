## An overview of variable selection in multiple regression

This repository contains a series of [R
notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) I
developed to illustrate some basic principles of variable selection in
multiple regression. I make no claim to be an expert. I am simply
sharing what I understand about the principles. You'll need to have
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed to take
full advantage of the R notebook features, but the open source version
of RStudio has served my needs well,<a href="#fn1"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it will only cost you a little disk
space.

Note: Github doesn't support viewing the HTML from R notebooks, so you won't be able to view them directly from here. You'll be able to open them from your computer if you download them and point your browser to the local file, but if you'd like to see what they look like before downloading them, you can find a links to them from the collection of blog posts I've made [https://github.com/kholsinger/variable-selection/edit/master/README.md](https://github.com/kholsinger/variable-selection/edit/master/README.md). There's one blog post for each notebook, and each blog post has a very brief introduction to each of them.

    editor in RStudio when I'm editing an R notebook. Otherwise,
    Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is my
    editor of choice.</p></li>

## An overview of variable selection in multiple regression

This repository contains a series of [R
notebooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) I
developed to illustrate some basic principles of variable selection in
multiple regression. I make no claim to be an expert. I am simply
sharing what I understand about the principles. Since these are R
notebooks, you can download the entire source code for any of them
simply by clicking on the link below, the clicking the "Code" button
in the top right when the page opens, and selecting "Download Rmd"
from the dropdown menu. You'll need to have
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed to take
full advantage of the R notebook features, but the open source version
of RStudio has served my needs well,<a href="#fn1"

space.

<li id="fn1">I've been using editors long enough, though, that I only use the
    editor in RStudio when I'm editing an R notebook. Otherwise,
    [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is my
    editor of choice.
